The Lost Dungeon
Author: Johnny Zheng
Version 04.25.23


The Lost Dungeon is a turn-based strategy game that tests your abilties to reason and keep track of information. Because both applications files are .exe (Windows Executable File), they are only compatible on Windows. 

Note: .exe files may trigger antivirus and protection software. If such messages show up, you may need to click on "More Info" then "Run Anyway".


Not on Windows or Cannot Open Files
That said, the .jar (Java Archive) versions of both .exe files are included in this folder. If you do not have a Windows or cannot run the files by clicking on them, run the jar files through the command prompt. Don't forget to include the VM Arguements when you run them. Instructions for command prompt is not included. 


This folder contains the following direction files. Please look through these files in the order listed below before starting the game. 

README.txt
Rules.pdf
Determining Location.pdf
Interactions.pdf
Player Grid Controls.txt
Game Tracker.txt


The application files listed below run the program. Please run the appropriate file based on whether you are playing or overseeing the game.

MasterGrid.exe
PlayerGrid.exe


The JAR files below can be ran in command line with VM arguments if you cannot open the .exe files. Remember to run the appropriate one based on your role in the game.

PlayerEnd.jar
MasterEnd.jar


The folders listed below contain the entirety of the java library (jdk-17.0.1) and the javaFx graphical interface (javafx-sdk-17.0.2) used to the run these programs. Because the applications are made in javaFx and require a Java runtime environment, they are both necessary. Since I did not know what parts of the folders to include, I included everything pertaining to Java (17.0.1) and JavaFx (17.0.2). They take up a fair amount of space but do not tinker with these folders even if you already have java and javaFx installed as the .exe files will look for the files within the foler to run them!
